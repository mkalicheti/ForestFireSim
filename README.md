# Cellular Automata for Wildfire Spread and Recovery

This repository contains the code and results of a study that presents two distinct approaches to forest fire spread modeling using cellular automata: multi-agent-based (Model 1) and multi-parameter (Model 2) simulations. The goal of this work is to simulate realistic forest fires and evaluate intervention strategies.

## Abstract
This study presents two distinct approaches to forest fire spread modeling using cellular automata: multi-agent-based (Model 1) and multi-parameter (Model 2) simulations. Model 1 explores various cell states and firefighting interventions, while Model 2 accounts for factors such as ground elevation, wind speed and direction, vegetation type, and density. The goal of this work is to simulate realistic forest fires and evaluate intervention strategies. Experiments on both models reveal the complex dynamics of forest fires and the effectiveness of different intervention techniques. Results highlight the potential for developing more comprehensive models by combining both approaches. Future work includes incorporating additional strategies, such as fire lines and aerial support, as well as prevention methods.
